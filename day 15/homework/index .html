<i>Muhammad Ali (/ɑːˈliː/;[2] born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.; January 17, 1942 – June 3, 2016) was an American professional boxer and social 
    activist.[a] A global cultural icon, widely known by the epithet "The Greatest", he is frequently cited as the greatest heavyweight boxer
     of all time. He held the Ring magazine heavyweight title from 1964 to 1970, was the undisputed champion from 1974 to 1978, and was the
     WBA and Ring heavyweight champion from 1978 to 1979. In 1999, he was named Sportsman of the Century by Sports Illustrated and the Sports
      Personality of the Century by the BBC.</i>
      <u>He fought in several historic boxing matches, including his highly publicized fights with Sonny Liston, Joe Frazier (including the Fight 
        of the Century, the biggest boxing event up until then), the Thrilla in Manila, and his fight with George Foreman in The Rumble in the 
        Jungle. Ali thrived in the spotlight at a time when many boxers let their managers do the talking, and he became renowned for his 
        provocative and outlandish persona. He was famous for trash-talking, often free-styled with rhyme schemes and spoken word poetry, 
        and has been recognized as a pioneer in hip hop. He often predicted in which round he would knock out his opponent. As a boxer, Ali 
        was known for his unorthodox movement, fancy footwork, head movement, and rope-a-dope technique, among others.</u>
        <b>Outside boxing, Ali attained success as a spoken word artist, releasing two studio albums: I Am the Greatest! (1963) and The Adventures
             of Ali and His Gang vs. Mr. Tooth Decay (1976). Both albums received Grammy Award nominations. He also featured as an actor and 
             writer, releasing two autobiographies. Ali retired from boxing in 1981 and focused on religion, philanthropy, and activism. In 1984, 
             he made public his diagnosis of Parkinson's syndrome, which some reports attributed to boxing-related injuries, though he and his 
             specialist physicians disputed this. He remained an active public figure globally, but in his later years made fewer public 
             appearances as his condition worsened, and was cared for by his family.
