<b>Michael Gerard Tyson (born June 30, 1966) is an American former professional boxer who competed between 1985 and 2024.<br> Nicknamed
     "Iron Mike"[4] and "Kid Dynamite" in his early career, and later known as "the Baddest Man on the Planet",[5]<br> Tyson is regarded as one 
     of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time.[6] He reigned as the undisputed world heavyweight champion from 1987 to 1990.</b>
     <i>Tyson won his first 19 professional fights by knockout, 12 of them in the first round. Claiming his first belt at 20 years, 4 months, and 
        22 days old, Tyson holds the record as the youngest boxer ever to win a heavyweight title.[7] He was the first heavyweight boxer to
         simultaneously hold the World Boxing Association (WBA), World Boxing Council (WBC), and International Boxing Federation (IBF) titles, as
          well as the only heavyweight to unify them in succession. The following year, Tyson became the lineal champion when he knocked out
           Michael Spinks in 91 seconds of the first round.[8] In 1990, Tyson lost the undisputed heavyweight championship when he was knocked out
            by underdog Buster Douglas, making it one of the biggest upsets in boxing history.[9]</i>
            <u>In 1992, he was convicted of rape and sentenced to six years in prison. He was released on parole after three years.[10] After his 
                release in 1995, he engaged in a series of comeback fights, regaining the WBA and WBC titles in 1996 to join Floyd Patterson,
                 Muhammad Ali, Tim Witherspoon, Evander Holyfield and George Foreman as the only men in boxing history to have regained a 
                 heavyweight championship after losing it. After being stripped of the WBC title in the same year, Tyson lost the WBA title to 
                 Evander Holyfield by an eleventh round stoppage. Their 1997 rematch ended when Tyson was disqualified for biting Holyfield's ears. In 2002, Tyson fought for the world heavyweight title, losing by knockout to Lennox Lewis. In November 2024, his bout against Jake Paul, which he lost via unanimous decision, became the biggest boxing gate in US history outside of Las Vegas.[11][12]</u>

                 <p>tyson was known for his ferocious and intimidating boxing style as well as his controversial behavior inside and outside the 
                    ring, which he explained was inspired by Sonny Liston, a boxer who is widely regarded as the most intimidating man in
                     the history of boxing.[13][14] With a knockout-to-win percentage of 88%,[15] he was ranked 16th on The Ring magazine's list 
                     of 100 greatest punchers of all time,[16] and first on ESPN's list of "The Hardest Hitters in Heavyweight History".[17] Sky
                      Sports described him as "perhaps the most ferocious fighter to step into a professional ring".[18] He has been inducted into 
                      the International Boxing Hall of Fame and the World Boxing Hall of Fame.
                    Outside his boxing career, Tyson has appeared in various popular media. He appeared in the well-received movies Rocky
                     Balboa
                     (2006) and The Hangover (2009).</p>
                     <i>Michael Gerard Tyson was born in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, New York City, on June 30, 1966.[19][20] He has an older brother 
                        named Rodney (born c. 1961)[21] and had an older sister named Denise, who died of a heart attack at age 24 in February 
                        1990.[22] Tyson's mother, born in Charlottesville, Virginia,[23] was described as a promiscuous woman who might have 
                        been a prostitute.[24] Tyson's biological father is listed as "Purcell Tyson", a "humble cab driver" (who was from Jamaica) on his birth certificate,[25][26] but the man Tyson had known as his father was a pimp named Jimmy Kirkpatrick. Kirkpatrick was from Grier Town, North Carolina (a predominantly black neighborhood that was annexed by the city of Charlotte),[27] where he was one of the neighborhood's top baseball players. Kirkpatrick married and had a son, Tyson's half-brother Jimmie Lee Kirkpatrick, who would help to integrate Charlotte high school football in 1965. In 1959, Jimmy Kirkpatrick left his family and moved to Brooklyn, where he met Tyson's mother, Lorna Mae (Smith) Tyson. Kirkpatrick frequented pool halls, gambled and hung out on the streets. "My father was just a regular street guy caught up in the street world," Tyson said. Kirkpatrick abandoned the Tyson family around the time Mike was born, leaving Tyson's mother to care for the children on her own.[28] Kirkpatrick died in 1992.[29]
                        The family lived in Bedford-Stuyvesant until their financial burdens necessitated a move to Brownsville when Tyson was
                         10 years old.[30] Throughout his childhood, Tyson lived in and around neighborhoods with a high rate of crime. According 
                         to an interview in Details, his first fight was with a bigger youth who had pulled the head off one of Tyson's 
                         pigeons.[31] Tyson was repeatedly caught committing petty crimes and fighting those who ridiculed his high-pitched 
                         voice and lisp. By the age of 13, he had been arrested 38 times.[32] He ended up at the Tryon School for Boys in
                          Johnstown, New York. Tyson's emerging boxing ability was discovered there by Bobby Stewart, a juvenile detention
                           center counselor and former boxer. Stewart considered Tyson to be an outstanding fighter and trained him for a few months before introducing him to boxing manager and trainer Cus D'Amato.[28] Tyson dropped out of high school as a junior.[33] He was later awarded an honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters from Central State University in 1989.[34] Kevin Rooney also trained Tyson, and he was occasionally assisted by Teddy Atlas, although Atlas was dismissed by D'Amato when Tyson was 15. Rooney eventually took over all training duties for the young fighter.[35]                       
                        Tyson's mother died when he was 16, leaving him in the care of D'Amato, who would become his legal guardian. Tyson 
                        later said, "I never saw my mother happy with me and proud of me for doing something: she only knew me as being a wild kid
                         running the streets, coming home with new clothes that she knew I didn't pay for. I never got a chance to talk to her or
                          know about her. Professionally, it has no effect, but it's crushing emotionally and personally."[36]</i>
                          <p>As an amateur, Tyson won gold medals at the 1981 and 1982 Junior Olympic Games, defeating Joe Cortez in 1981 and beating 
                            Kelton Brown in 1982. Brown's corner threw in the towel in the first round. In 1984 Tyson won the gold medal at the Nation
                             Golden Gloves held in New York, beating Jonathan Littles.[37] He fought Henry Tillman twice as an amateur, losing both
                              bouts by decision. Tillman went on to win heavyweight gold at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.[38]</p>

                          <p>Tyson made his professional debut as an 18-year-old on March 6, 1985, in Albany, New York. He defeated Hector Mercedes
                             via first-round TKO.[28] He had 15 bouts in his first year as a professional. Fighting frequently, Tyson won 26 of
                              his first 28 fights by KO or TKO; 16 of those came in the first round.[39] The quality of his opponents gradually
                               increased to journeyman fighters and borderline contenders,[39] like James Tillis, David Jaco, Jesse Ferguson
                               Mitch Green, and Marvis Frazier. His win streak attracted media attention and Tyson was billed as the next great
                                heavyweight champion. D'Amato died in November 1985, relatively early into Tyson's professional career, and some
                                 speculate that his death was the catalyst to many of the troubles Tyson was to experience as his life and career
                                  progressed.[40]</p>
                          <p>Rise up the ranks
                            Tyson's first nationally televised bout took place on February 16, 1986, at Houston Field House in Troy, New York,
                             against journeyman heavyweight Jesse Ferguson, and was carried by ABC Sports. Tyson knocked down Ferguson with an
                              uppercut in the fifth round that broke Ferguson's nose.[41] During the sixth round, Ferguson began to hold and 
                              clinch Tyson in an apparent attempt to avoid further punishment. After admonishing Ferguson several times to obey
                               his commands to box, the referee finally stopped the fight near the middle of the sixth round. The fight was 
                               initially ruled a win for Tyson by disqualification (DQ) of his opponent. The ruling was "adjusted" to a win by
                                technical knockout (TKO) after Tyson's corner protested that a DQ win would end Tyson's string of knockout 
                                victories, and that a knockout would have been the inevitable result.
                            In July, after recording six more knockout victories, Tyson fought former world title challenger Marvis Frazier in 
                            Glens Falls, New York, on another ABC Sports broadcast. Tyson won easily, charging at Frazier at the opening bell 
                            and hitting him with two consecutive uppercuts, the second of which knocked Frazier unconscious thirty seconds into
                             the fight.[42]
                            After his win over Frazier, Tyson was booked to fight José Ribalta at the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic
                             City, New Jersey in 1986.[43] Ribalta would hit Tyson in the body throughout the fight. Tyson knocked down Ribalta
                              three times in the 2nd, 8th, and 10th round when the referee called the fight off. Tyson would go on to say that
                               Ribalta was his toughest fight commenting, "I hit Jose Ribalta with everything, and he took everything and kept
                               coming back for more. Jose Ribalta stood toe to toe with me. He was very strong in the clinches," and "Ribalta 
                               was a game fighter who actually engaged me. I felt nauseous from all Ribalta’s body blows, even hours after the 
                               fight. I never felt that much general pain again."[43]</p>

                            Tyson vs. Berbick
                            See also: Trevor Berbick vs. Mike Tyson
                            On November 22, 1986, Tyson was given his first title fight against Trevor Berbick for the World Boxing Council (WBC)
                             heavyweight championship. Tyson won the title by TKO in the second round, and at the age of 20 years and 4 months
                              became the youngest heavyweight champion in history.[44] He added the WBA and IBF titles after defeating James
                               Smith and Tony Tucker in 1987. Tyson's dominant performances brought many accolades. Donald Saunders wrote:
                                "The noble and manly art of boxing can at least cease worrying about its immediate future, now [that] it has
                                 discovered a heavyweight champion fit to stand alongside Dempsey, Tunney, Louis, Marciano, and Ali."[45]                            
                            Tyson intimidated fighters with his strength, combined with outstanding hand speed, accuracy, coordination and 
                            timing.[46] Tyson also possessed notable defensive abilities, holding his hands high in the peek-a-boo style taught 
                            by his mentor Cus D'Amato[47][48] to slip under and weave around his opponent's punches while timing his own.[48]
                             Tyson's explosive punching technique was due in large part to crouching immediately prior to throwing a hook or 
                             an uppercut: this allowed the "spring" of his legs to add power to the punch.[49] Among his signature moves was 
                             a right hook to his opponent's body followed by a right uppercut to his opponent's chin. Lorenzo Boyd, Jesse 
                             Ferguson and José Ribalta were each knocked down by this combination.[50]</p>
